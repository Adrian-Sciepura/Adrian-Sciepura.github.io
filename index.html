                My name is Adrian Ściepura, I am currently a student of computer science 
                at <span class="text--higlight">Gdansk University of Technology</span>. I am passionate about long-distance 
                road cycling and programming - especially in C family languages.
                <br><br>
                My adventure with computer science began as early as junior high school, when 
                I became interested in building programs or games in addition to just running 
                them. Over time, I began to create my own. Each new project motivates me 
                even more to act and take on increasingly difficult challenges.
